            <p>For this project I have chosen to focus on things that I enjoy, books and movies particularly. I love stories,
                and this love of story is also ultimately what has guided me on my career path through art history and in pursuit of collections work. 
                What has drawn me to collections work is the stories that are housed in collections, 
                through individual objects as well as the interaction of objects in a collection. </p>
            <h5>This site includes various sections to share some of the media that I've been thinking about recently.</h5>
            <p>It's by no means exhasutive, and my favorites change all the time. This is really just a snapshot of what I'm
                currently interested in.</p>
