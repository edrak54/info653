            <p>I am pursuing a Masters in Library and Information Science, with a particular interest in museum collections and archives. </p>
            <p>Before beginning at Pratt, I earned a BA in Art History and completed an internship in the collections department at the South Street Seaport Museum.</p>
            <p>At the Seaport Museum, I was responsible for cataloging a collection of maritime postcards, including documentation and description. 
                As part of the conclusion of my time at the Seaport Museum, I cowrote a post for their Collections Chronicles Blog titled, 
                <a href="https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/missives-from-the-past/">Missives from the Past,</a> which details some of the work I did there. 
                I draw on my experience at the Seaport Museum as a foundational experience contributing to why I am pursuing the work that I am.</p>
            <p>I currently live in New York City and I'm from Baltimore, MD, another important east coast port city.</p>
