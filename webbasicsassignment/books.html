            <p>I have always loved books. I have a collection of over 100 books in my apartment (the reason I can never move again).
                In my undergraduate degree, I wrote my thesis about book cover design, to combine my coursework in art history, graphic design, and my interest in books.

            <h5 class="line">*A Note On Bookbinding</h5>
            <p>For six months in 2018, I was able to work in a university library conservation lab. The lab had two primary elements, 
                book conservation, and material science study of paper. I spent most of my time learning bookbinding as well as assisting with 
                research for a study on mechanical properties of aged paper. 
                My bookbinding work included a variety of different historic and contemporary techniques.</p>
